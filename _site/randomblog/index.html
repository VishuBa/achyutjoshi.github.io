      <time datetime="2017-02-11T03:43:39+05:30" class="post-date">February 11, 2017</time>

      <p>PowerPoint was developed by engineers as a tool to help them communicate in a better way. The programmers behind PowerPoint saw it as a clever hack—a way to save time and money instead of creating slides the old fashioned way. It is an amazing tool for presenting your ideas in a way that the audience can relate to! However, we, the users, have made a complete mockery of presentations. To a certain extent, Microsoft is to blame for the dismal built-in wizards, templates and clip-arts - those hideous Microsoft creations.</p>

<p>I have noticed some abysmal design mistakes in various powerpoints. Some of them which can be easily prevented are -</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Text Too Small</strong> - Before deciding on the text size of your content, you should understand the size of the audience and the room you will be presenting it. Change your font size accordingly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dreadful colour schemes</strong> - There is no point of your powerpoint if your colour scheme sucks and as a result, no one is able to understand the slides.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Too many bullet points</strong> - Bullet points are supposed to be used to communicate important points. Never use them in excess otherwise they lose the importance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bad selection of fonts</strong> - Being a novice designer myself, there are no words through which I can emphasize the importance of fonts. I spend at least 30 minutes to decide my fonts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Videos and Audios never work</strong> - Embedded videos and audios don’t work most of the time. Moreover, they break the flow of your presentation. Play them either at the end or at the start. Avoid them in the middle of your presentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Too many slide transitions &amp; animations</strong> - They do more bad than good. These can get rather tiring on the audience and thus keep the powerpoint simple.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reading off each word</strong> - Did your audience really have to come all this way to a meeting to listen to you read the slides? Why not just send them over? Never, just never make this mistake!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The one underlying fact every one of us should understand is - <em>presentations are made to make communication seamless and easy.</em> Therefore before presenting, take a moment and imagine yourself as the audience and ask the question - “Will this powerpoint aid me to understand the idea better?”. If you have even a 5% of doubt, change the powerpoint!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As Seth Godin rightly points out, Communication is the transfer of emotion. Communication is about getting others to adopt your point of view, to help them understand why you’re excited (or sad, or optimistic or whatever else you are.) PowerPoint presents an amazing opportunity. You can use the screen to talk emotionally to the audience’s right brain (through their eyes), and your words can go through the audience’s ears to talk to their left brain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certain Pointers that will help you become a better presenter -</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cue Cards</strong> -  Make yourself a cue card for each slide. It should cover all the points that you want to make and thus these cards will provide a basic framework and storyline for your presentation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Slides to aid your words</strong> - Make slides that reinforce your words, not repeat them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A Leave-behind</strong> - Create a printed document which works as a summary of your content and give it to your audience after you have finished with your presentation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No more than <strong>six words on a slide</strong>. EVER.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>10/20/30 Rule</strong> -  It recommends limiting the number of your slides to 10 and your presentation time to 20 minutes but using at least a 30-point font size.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You will find many such hacks and rules that provide you with a framework to make the most from your powerpoint presentation. However, you will have to decide your own rules suiting your style.</p>

<p>To conclude, PowerPoints and other presentation tools are visual aids. You want to connect how your slide looks to what you’re saying and present it in a form of a story.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The home run is easy to describe: You put up a slide. It triggers an emotional reaction in the audience. They sit up and want to know what you’re going to say that fits in with that image. Then, if you do it right, every time they think of what you said, they’ll see the image (and vice versa).</p>

      <h4 class="post-title"><a class="post-link" href="/randomblog/what-after-graduation">What After Graduation?</a></h4>

      <time datetime="2016-12-29T15:30:39+05:30" class="post-date">December 29, 2016</time>

      <p>One of my major goals of 2016 was to inch closer to a particular career path that I will embark on after I graduate. However, like all new year goals, I am not even close to deciding what I want to do after I finish by B.Tech.</p>

<p>These four years of college have been enlightening in many ways but unlike many of my batchmates, I have grown more confused about my future. There are infinite opportunities out there and with a tad bit of experience I have eliminated some and confused between some.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><strong>MBA</strong></p>

<p>Before my summer internship with Accenture, I was certain about MBA and even had started preparing for CAT. However, the two months made me realise that I was not yet ready to pull out from the technical world. Coincidentally, I was introduced to data analytics by a friend and as I dug deeper into the field, it got enthralling. MBA was eliminated and so enters MS.</p>

<p><strong>MS(Master of Science)</strong></p>

<p>In undergraduate coursework, we do not study any dedicated coursework for data analytics. There are only certain introductory courses on probability, database systems and machine learning. Thus a post graduation study becomes mandatory if one seriously wants to go deeper into this particular field. However, in my case, because MS became an option like a bomb, waiting for a year or two to gain some experience in this field and then opting for an MS in data analytics seemed more logical. Thus, MS is also eliminated for the time being(at least for a year or two).</p>

<p><strong>Job Experience</strong></p>

<p>Anyone with even a two-month industry exposure can bet on his life and tell that the undergraduate coursework and actual industry implementation are two different worlds. No doubt, the coursework and the projects help in the process of completing a job but the whole experience is divergent. Therefore, right now, getting a job experience seems to be the best and the safest option. Apart from earning some money, it will also provide with a good technical exposure in data analytics.</p>

<p>However, there is a twist in this story too! Working with a startup and working for a big multi-national serves two totally different objectives. Generally speaking, a startup is a more unstable, risky and yet more satisfying, challenging &amp; developing option. Personally, having secured a job at Accenture, I am currently hunting for opportunities in a startup and then will decide the best way forward.</p>

<p><strong>Starting up my own venture</strong></p>

<p>Startify, my first startup, was a breathtaking experience and once it got acquired my decision to hunt for a job came as a surprise to many. However, to those who know Startify inside out, it would have been very difficult to make Startify profitable &amp; sustainable. Not every startup idea is worth building!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>It is my belief that an idea originates from a problem and a problem is identified by your surroundings. So, if you get an industry exposure for a few years, you would be exposed to a whole new set of problems, that you wouldn’t have known if you had decided to start right after college.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having said that, there is nothing wrong in starting up right after college if you have found a problem that you are really passionate about. In my case, I have not found that yet and so entrepreneurship is on hold for some time and I am keeping my eyes and ears open to stumble upon a problem that is worth solving for me.</p>

<p><strong>Young India Fellowship</strong></p>

<p>I got introduced to this particular option by a senior. The Young India Fellowship is basically a one-year multidisciplinary postgraduate diploma programme in Liberal Studies. From the day I read about YIF, it has got me intrigued. <em>YIF will provide a good gap year along with spending a year learning something valuable.</em> The admission process is very selective and currently, I am waiting for my 2nd round results.</p>

<p>If I get selected and opt to go forward with joining YIF, it might deviate me from my data analytics track. However, on the other hand, it will give me an opportunity to learn some abstract topics like politics, literature, law &amp; arts and interact with some amazing like-minded people from India. Now, that is some leverage which would be difficult to let go for a person like me!</p>

<p><strong>Digital Nomad &amp; Volunteering</strong></p>

<p>The whole scene of living among a new culture like Vietnam and along with helping underprivileged children there, exploring and making fascinating memories has always captivated me. Moreover, in this digital world, earning by freelancing is not an impossible task.  Stories of millennials working from the Himalayas and living their dream are very common these days. I have often heard that once we get into the vicious cycle of earning, taking time out for such dreams take impossible courage. <em>Then why not tick off such items from the bucket list right after graduation?</em></p>

<p><strong>The Final Verdict (<em>Never getting there!</em>)</strong></p>

<p>There are some safe bets, and there are some risky &amp; yet attractive alternatives. On one hand, if I see myself as someone who wants to be a data scientist, taking up a job and then pursuing higher education seems the logical step. However, the hustler inside me prefers taking the risky option of a gap year and trying out new experiences.</p>

      <h4 class="post-title"><a class="post-link" href="/randomblog/It-is-that-time-again">It is that time of year again</a></h4>

      <time datetime="2016-09-24T18:43:39+05:30" class="post-date">September 24, 2016</time>

      <p>It is that time of the year again - the dreaded placements. The same block where once I used to hear noisy birthday bashing or the typical Hindi abuses while playing Counter Strike is now a hostile territory of men at work!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>It is bloody amusing to find yourself in this very rat race in spite of all the protective shells you try to pretend to wear. There are days where I have nightmares of not getting placed in a good company, or even worse, having my best friends placed and not me. Hell! When did this get so competitive &amp; stressful? But it is actually not our mistake. This is the exact way it has happened in the past, and we will follow it blindly.</p>

<p>I still remember my JEE preparation days and the same very rat race that I ran. We all were sailing in the same boat. With no clear inclinations towards a field of study or interests, we ran, we ran hard for two long years without looking back with just one goal - IIT. And on the day the result was announced I never felt so empty, with no ambitions &amp; no purpose. But then IIT Jodhpur happened.</p>

<p>IITs might not be great academically, and especially not IIT Jodhpur, but these 4 years serves you something which might get you back your purpose. Ample of opportunities in the fields you cannot even imagine, friends &amp; seniors who will really sail the world to get you out of trouble and learnings which will stay with you the rest of your life. My three years were something very similar.</p>

<p>I enrolled into a very new branch of Systems Science(even after 3 years, I still don’t know what it is ) in a new IIT. Aspiring to get my branch changed, I studied hard for the first midsem, but soon I came to know I had brilliant classmates, who are more deserving. Since school days I loved programming so I tried competitive programming but soon gave that up too. Then entrepreneurship happened. I got introduced to it by a dear friend, with whom I would end up starting my own venture, and we went crazy. The next two years were energetic, colourful and worth every bit of the hardship. I also got acquainted to data analytics and dived into this field to learn more. In a nutshell, these 3 years I learnt and experienced things that I wouldn’t if I were somewhere else.</p>

<p>But then it arrived. The fucking fourth and final year. Again it felt like the good old JEE days. Everyone running behind their aims of jobs, masters, MBA etc etc. I am sure many of them are actually interested in whatever they are pursuing, but not me. I have not freaking idea on what I am doing!</p>

<p>I had promised myself that I won’t run that race again but here I am, reading things for getting a job and spending a good 3-4 hours a day hunting jobs. Why? Do we really need this?</p>

      <h4 class="post-title"><a class="post-link" href="/randomblog/what-i-learnt-by-speaking-to-school-kids">What I learnt by speaking in front of 120 school kids</a></h4>

      <time datetime="2016-04-07T18:43:39+05:30" class="post-date">April 07, 2016</time>

      <p>After a long long time, today when I entered the auditorium of MPS Jodhpur (a school in Jodhpur) I started missing my school again. As we grow up, we begin to get indifferent to things from our past. But that auditorium, those young kids in uniform and those teachers shouting at them to shut up, brought back happy memories from my Vidyani days.</p>

<image src="/assets/images/mps1.jpg"></image>

<p>We were invited by the school administration to give a two-hour talk on engineering, entrepreneurship and basic motivation. Having an experience of giving talks many times, this particular event was special for us. It was the first time we spoke in front of school kids. We had brainstormed a lot and tried to find out ingenious ways of presenting in front of these young lads. The key hurdle was to guess their level of understanding and intelligence. We as college students tend to take certain things for granted which are not very obvious at a school level. But somehow we managed and it was a hell of an event!</p>

<p>So as soon as we entered the auditorium, the students started to gaze at us as if we were some aliens. Remember the times when we as school kids used to gossip and stare at anyone who is new? Being at the other end of the dais made me realise how creepy we used to be! We were felicitated by the Headmistress of the school and then were invited to start our talk.</p>

<image src="/assets/images/mps2.jpg"></image>

<p>The talk consisted of us telling our stories and sharing our regrets with the students. It was mainly ‘gyaan’ and more importantly, we had to put it in a way that they can relate to. Slowly as we progressed, surprisingly and to our amazement, those students opened up and started to ask some beguiling doubts. We were startled by their level of knowledge, enthusiasm and the curiosity to know things. They knew the basic mechanisms of a business including marketing, sales, product development and funding! Things which I personally learnt only after getting into college.</p>

<p>Whenever Himanshu (the other person who was speaking with me) spoke, I intently watched how the students reacted. The way they were looking up to us and expecting something great from us made me realise how influential we can be. As seniors, we have the power to mould them in the best way possible and as one of the teachers of the school put it, “Students can easily connect with people of similar ages!”. Whenever they got a chance, they used to jump out of their seat and come running to us with all sort of questions and believe me it is very difficult to convince a 16- year old school kid who won’t leave you unless he has a perfect answer.</p>

<p>And when we were walking out of the room after our talk, everyone in the room started clapping. In that one moment, one small moment, I lived one of the best times in my life. It feels satisfying to see that you caused a change in someone’s life. We were again felicitated in the principal’s office and were offered with snacks(a big thing for any hosteler!).</p>

<p>Even while I am writing this, I received a mail from one of the students seeking my advice. That is enough to prove that we succeeded in our endeavour in some small way. The whole experience was rejuvenating, nostalgic and enlightening to say the least. This day will certainly be remembered for a long time to come.</p>

      <p>I had written in my earlier post, that I would become an early riser this year. I tried and I failed.</p>

<p>It has been 2 months and 21 days and I am ashamed to share that I woke up early only for 23 days. It doesn’t mean that I hated waking up early, I loved it. The serenity, the calmness and the solitude was addictive, but it wasn’t addictive enough to wake an lazy ass like me.</p>

<p>I tried many things. I read a lot. I made a morning routine. I applied all the technicalities of making a habit as explained by Charles Duhigg. I spent an hour identifying the cues and rewards and made a 15-day plan for the same. I followed it for some days and then I just stopped. Meditating in the morning was refreshing and so was exercising and drinking a cup of warm lemon water. Yet I couldn’t continue it.</p>

<p>The whole experiment made me to doubt myself. I had always thought myself to be someone who cannot persist with one thing. And this whole incident proved it to me. It is very agonizing to know your mistakes and yet be helpless to solve it. The failure may be due to the fact that my schedule is unpredictable. Whatever may it be, one thing I know for sure – I failed!</p>

<p>Therefore, for the time being, I quit and I no longer will be trying to wake up early. I will come back to it, once I finish with my engineering.</p>

<p>PS. I have my whole experiment documented. If anyone wants to try it, I will be more than happy to share!</p>
