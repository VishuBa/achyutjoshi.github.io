      <p>It is that time of the year again - the dreaded placements. The same block where once I used to hear noisy birthday bashing or the typical Hindi abuses while playing Counter Strike is now a hostile territory of men at work!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>It is bloody amusing to find yourself in this very rat race in spite of all the protective shells you try to pretend to wear. There are days where I have nightmares of not getting placed in a good company, or even worse, having my best friends placed and not me. Hell! When did this get so competitive &amp; stressful? But it is actually not our mistake. This is the exact way it has happened in the past, and we will follow it blindly.</p>

<p>I still remember my JEE preparation days and the same very rat race that I ran. We all were sailing in the same boat. With no clear inclinations towards a field of study or interests, we ran, we ran hard for two long years without looking back with just one goal - IIT. And on the day the result was announced I never felt so empty, with no ambitions &amp; no purpose. But then IIT Jodhpur happened.</p>

<p>IITs might not be great academically, and especially not IIT Jodhpur, but these 4 years serves you something which might get you back your purpose. Ample of opportunities in the fields you cannot even imagine, friends &amp; seniors who will really sail the world to get you out of trouble and learnings which will stay with you the rest of your life. My three years were something very similar.</p>

<p>I enrolled into a very new branch of Systems Science(even after 3 years, I still don’t know what it is ) in a new IIT. Aspiring to get my branch changed, I studied hard for the first midsem, but soon I came to know I had brilliant classmates, who are more deserving. Since school days I loved programming so I tried competitive programming but soon gave that up too. Then entrepreneurship happened. I got introduced to it by a dear friend, with whom I would end up starting my own venture, and we went crazy. The next two years were energetic, colourful and worth every bit of the hardship. I also got acquainted to data analytics and dived into this field to learn more. In a nutshell, these 3 years I learnt and experienced things that I wouldn’t if I were somewhere else.</p>

<p>But then it arrived. The fucking fourth and final year. Again it felt like the good old JEE days. Everyone running behind their aims of jobs, masters, MBA etc etc. I am sure many of them are actually interested in whatever they are pursuing, but not me. I have not freaking idea on what I am doing!</p>

<p>I had promised myself that I won’t run that race again but here I am, reading things for getting a job and spending a good 3-4 hours a day hunting jobs. Why? Do we really need this?</p>

      <h4 class="post-title"><a class="post-link" href="/randomblog/what-i-learnt-by-speaking-to-school-kids">What I learnt by speaking in front of 120 school kids</a></h4>

      <time datetime="2016-04-07T18:43:39+05:30" class="post-date">April 07, 2016</time>

      <p>After a long long time, today when I entered the auditorium of MPS Jodhpur (a school in Jodhpur) I started missing my school again. As we grow up, we begin to get indifferent to things from our past. But that auditorium, those young kids in uniform and those teachers shouting at them to shut up, brought back happy memories from my Vidyani days.</p>

<image src="/assets/images/mps1.jpg"></image>

<p>We were invited by the school administration to give a two-hour talk on engineering, entrepreneurship and basic motivation. Having an experience of giving talks many times, this particular event was special for us. It was the first time we spoke in front of school kids. We had brainstormed a lot and tried to find out ingenious ways of presenting in front of these young lads. The key hurdle was to guess their level of understanding and intelligence. We as college students tend to take certain things for granted which are not very obvious at a school level. But somehow we managed and it was a hell of an event!</p>

<p>So as soon as we entered the auditorium, the students started to gaze at us as if we were some aliens. Remember the times when we as school kids used to gossip and stare at anyone who is new? Being at the other end of the dais made me realise how creepy we used to be! We were felicitated by the Headmistress of the school and then were invited to start our talk.</p>

<image src="/assets/images/mps2.jpg"></image>

<p>The talk consisted of us telling our stories and sharing our regrets with the students. It was mainly ‘gyaan’ and more importantly, we had to put it in a way that they can relate to. Slowly as we progressed, surprisingly and to our amazement, those students opened up and started to ask some beguiling doubts. We were startled by their level of knowledge, enthusiasm and the curiosity to know things. They knew the basic mechanisms of a business including marketing, sales, product development and funding! Things which I personally learnt only after getting into college.</p>

<p>Whenever Himanshu (the other person who was speaking with me) spoke, I intently watched how the students reacted. The way they were looking up to us and expecting something great from us made me realise how influential we can be. As seniors, we have the power to mould them in the best way possible and as one of the teachers of the school put it, “Students can easily connect with people of similar ages!”. Whenever they got a chance, they used to jump out of their seat and come running to us with all sort of questions and believe me it is very difficult to convince a 16- year old school kid who won’t leave you unless he has a perfect answer.</p>

<image src="/assets/images/mps3.jpg"></image>

<p>And when we were walking out of the room after our talk, everyone in the room started clapping. In that one moment, one small moment, I lived one of the best times in my life. It feels satisfying to see that you caused a change in someone’s life. We were again felicitated in the principal’s office and were offered with snacks(a big thing for any hosteler!).</p>

<p>Even while I am writing this, I received a mail from one of the students seeking my advice. That is enough to prove that we succeeded in our endeavour in some small way. The whole experience was rejuvenating, nostalgic and enlightening to say the least. This day will certainly be remembered for a long time to come.</p>

    <article class="post">
      <h4 class="post-title"><a class="post-link" href="/randomblog/i-failed">I Failed</a></h4>

      <time datetime="2016-03-20T18:43:39+05:30" class="post-date">March 20, 2016</time>

      <p>I had written in my earlier post, that I would become an early riser this year. I tried and I failed.</p>

<p>It has been 2 months and 21 days and I am ashamed to share that I woke up early only for 23 days. It doesn’t mean that I hated waking up early, I loved it. The serenity, the calmness and the solitude was addictive, but it wasn’t addictive enough to wake an lazy ass like me.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I tried many things. I read a lot. I made a morning routine. I applied all the technicalities of making a habit as explained by Charles Duhigg. I spent an hour identifying the cues and rewards and made a 15-day plan for the same. I followed it for some days and then I just stopped. Meditating in the morning was refreshing and so was exercising and drinking a cup of warm lemon water. Yet I couldn’t continue it.</p>

<p>The whole experiment made me to doubt myself. I had always thought myself to be someone who cannot persist with one thing. And this whole incident proved it to me. It is very agonizing to know your mistakes and yet be helpless to solve it. The failure may be due to the fact that my schedule is unpredictable. Whatever may it be, one thing I know for sure – I failed!</p>

<p>Therefore, for the time being, I quit and I no longer will be trying to wake up early. I will come back to it, once I finish with my engineering.</p>

<p>PS. I have my whole experiment documented. If anyone wants to try it, I will be more than happy to share!</p>
