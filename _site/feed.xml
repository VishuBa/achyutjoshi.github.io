        <title>Thailand #1 : In conversation with a Buddhist Monk who is now my Facebook friend </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been really fascinated by Buddhism - especially the intense devotion and motivation of the people to study the religion. To be frank, I was never curious about learning about Hinduism and I don’t see many being curious about the same. I met several people in Thailand who have been staying there for months to learn more about the teaching of the Buddha and practice meditation. There sure must be something of Buddhism which even attracts several atheists to give religion a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there I was, walking into Wat Chedi Luang - a buddhist temple in Chiang Mai, on scorching Saturday afternoon with the hope of attending the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bigboytravel.com/asia/thailand/chiangmai/monk-chat/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Monk Chat”&lt;/a&gt;. The northern part of the temple has some tables where the monks welcome curious travellers to interact with them who in turn get the chance to practice their English. What I imagined to be a good short &amp;amp; an awkward conversation, turned into a two-hour intense discussion about life, goals, meditation and death. An American couple from Texas joined us on the table, and if I may say, we all left a bit wiser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;image class=&quot;center-img&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/thailand1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/image&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I so wish I could have recorded the discussion, but then maybe it was better that it took place in the moment. I have tried to accumulate all that we discussed on that day, and as you will observe, the monk always had a simple anecdote to explain a complex idea :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is so different about Buddhism that it attracts so many people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has always been this curiosity regarding what is different in various religions that the human race follows. I used to believe that religion is something that divides the human race and have been the fire to some of the world’s deadliest wars. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0099590085/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=3638&amp;amp;creative=24630&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0099590085&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=achyutjoshi-21&amp;amp;linkId=da749671e8b9d0ed6acb52ee0a1ded7a&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Sapiens&lt;/a&gt; made me realise that the concept has equipped us to bring humans closer.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I asked this to the monk, he had a pretty interesting take on it. He drew a river of which, on one side is where all humans exist, and the other he termed as the “Happy Land”, where everyone wants to go. He then showcased three teachers, who are followers of three distinct religions. For Buddhism, he shared that Buddha &amp;amp; his teachings can only guide you how to build a boat, but the real work of building it and crossing the river is on the human. Every religion will have a different way to build that boat - but, in every case, the end goal is the same.   Buddhism does not force its followers to visit temples and perform certain rituals - but they sure do exist if you want to be a monk. But as a normal person, you are free to follow the teachings and consider yourself as a Buddhist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do the teachings of Buddha suggest the followers to give up materialistic possessions and live an aesthetic life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope. Never. As a matter of fact, the monk showed me his Apple tablet with a wide grin. He went on to narrate the story of Gautam Buddha and how he attained salvation. Buddha preaches that the life you are living is yours, and you are independent of living it the way you want. Earn money, buy a big house, but do good. Be good, do good and spread happiness, and it does not matter if you are the richest or the poorest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What controls our life? Does past affect us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always wondered how the cycle of life works. How our past sins can carry forward in our next birth and are we really stuck in a cycle of death-rebirth-death?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  The monk took out his water bottle and told us to imagine the water as our life. Whenever we do evil, we add blue ink to it. And whenever we do good, we add clean water to it. The goal of the life is to try and maintain the water to be as clean as possible. Buddhism, as he suggested, does not take past sins into considerations - you always live in the now. Even a murderer can achieve moksha if he does good in the remaining life time he has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens after we die? Hell, heaven, nirvana?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer : this particular answer was lost in translation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
But as far as I can remember, heaven &amp;amp; hell is down on earth itself. If you are a drunk husband misbehaving at your home, it is hell for you. But if you are a loving man, you make it heaven for your family. The everyday activities determine whether we are living in hell or heaven. And about nirvana, that is what every person aspires to reach. He tried explaining what nirvana is, but I could not make sense out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buddhism talks a lot about doing good. How to do good?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gratitude. Respect. Forgiveness. One can never articulate on how to do good - it is a matter of perspective. However, if you follow such practices in your daily life, you will eventually spread happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  The monk narrated how they are given jobs in the temples, right from sweeping the floor, washing clothes to cooking food. It teaches them to be grateful of what they have. And pointing to his trademark smile, he said, this is the one of the most powerful weapon we have. Smile as much as you can, and you will see the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is meditation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is meditation. If you are giving your 100% to a certain activity, it is meditation. Religions and teachers preach the very specific meditation that we learn because it is easier to close your eyes and focus on your breathing. But the end goal of this activity is to train ourselves to live in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  &lt;em&gt;I would suggest you to stop reading and contemplate what the monk meant by this!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is one thing you would want us to do more in life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are my favourite types of question because it forces the person to think.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monk went on to express how the digital age has forced our mind to wander off and not concentrate on one thing. “There are too many distractions”, he said while showing off his mobile phone. He said he would really want us to practice meditation, everyday. He also suggested to learn and live in the present. As a generation who is known to be competitive, we sure do tend to miss out on the little things in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do monks eat meat?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monks are dependent on alms and donations given by the people around the town( I was lucky to witness this solemn practice where monks walked around the city centre of Chiang Mai in the morning to collect alms). Therefore, as monks they do not have much choice and have to accept what they receive. However, the scripture sure do restrict eating certain animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is Dalai Lama and why are there no picture of him in Thailand?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two groups in Buddhism - Mahayana &amp;amp; Thervada. Theravada Buddhism is prevalent in countries like Sri Lanka, Thailand, Burma, Laos, Cambodia, parts of Southeast Asia. On the other hand, Mahayana Buddhism is prevalent in countries like Tibet, China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, India. Though both the groups are based on the same set of teachings by Buddha, there are certain difference in the way they practice. And Dalai Lama is the spiritual head of the Mahayana sect of the religion and therefore Thailand is totally void of any presence of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know for a fact that I am missing out on a lot of things that we talked, but I don’t seem to remember them. I tried to paraphrase most of the wisdom as much as I could remember from my notes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#6 - Rather than the breadth, lets do the depth!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been one week since I returned from my Thailand expedition - and it has not been that bad. Obviously, I don’t think I will ever be satisfied with myself, and that is perfectly okay. So, I hit the gym regularly for the whole week. I set up a good working space at my home - though could not work as much as I wanted to. But at least, there is some start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always tried to be an all-rounder - doing a good bunch of things whenever I got the chance. It might be because of the way I was brought up or because I have an acute fear of missing out. This has placed me in a box where I am a master of none. Therefore one thing that I have decided is to try going deep into a subject this time. And I spent the later part of the week deciding the field I want to go deep into - a classic case of me fearing of missing out, again! I have already taken up a few things - more on this next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also trying to automate the email updates for my blog through Mailchimp. Though, I need to figure out a way through which MailChimp selects RSS feeds of only certain categories of posts and convert it into a newsletter. And this has to be compatible with Jekyll and Github Pages. I will dig into this more the coming week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting Stumbles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/mimir-blockchain/the-birds-the-bees-and-the-merkle-trees-ep-0-blockchains-from-scratch-3cedb1e669eb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Blockchain&lt;/a&gt; - I have not completed this, but so far, this post have really helped to know the subject&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJkMlOu7faDgqh4PfzbpLdg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nerdwriter&lt;/a&gt; - An insightful youtube channel that is just a great way to spend time on the internet rather than surfing through the shit called Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is Us - The newest drama in my list which I binged watched through the week. For all those who are fans of good-old classic drama, This is Us won’t disappoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books,Books and Books&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0434023469/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=3638&amp;amp;creative=24630&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0434023469&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=achyutjoshi-21&amp;amp;linkId=63448d3e15ac4d5b82637cd3194e0a02&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Smarter, Faster and Better&lt;/a&gt; -I took up this book after hearing Duhigg talk about Mental Models in a Freakonomics podcast. I have completed around 30% of it it, and so far, there has been nothing extra-ordinary in the book. I have always been a big fan of Duhigg’s writing style, so hopefully this won’t disappoint.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0099578077/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=achyutjoshi-21&amp;amp;creative=24630&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0099578077&amp;amp;linkId=c7e966ae5f27509bfa376cf8eba3f0fb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1Q84&lt;/a&gt; - Murakami has this power of gripping your attention throughout the book. Another masterpiece by this Japanese superstar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music Discovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have often heard my friends telling how they hate finding new music. And yes, it is a pain-staking process. But I have these few hours once every two weeks where I devote the time to discover new music. Why not share them with the world?  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pre-trip Musings : Thailand #0</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just about 12 hours to go before I fly off to my first longish solo travel to the much famous land of smiles. My mind is wandering in all sorts of directions, but the majority opinion of my brain cells is - “What the hell? Don’t go Achyut!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, even though this is something that I have dreamt of since I read “Vagabonding” by Rolf Pott, I am shit scared. And my mind is playing the bad cop and giving me reasons not to go. But, nada! Not today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought I was the only one who is going through something like this. Having cold feet about such a big trip, anxious, nervous and scared. But I went on Reddit and read posts of novice and experienced travellers &amp;amp; they all faced the same issue. I guess this is how our human brain functions - not wanting to leave the comfort zone! And when we try to ignore the arguments, our mind builds a much stronger defence against the change - and that is where most of us give up, and let the mind win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are my fears right now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being an over-excited bastard that I am, I booked a 16-day trip without thinking of what I will do. Thank my parents who made me reduce it from 25 days. And now, I am worried of the fact that what will I do if I get bored.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest fear - what if I don’t meet people and I get lonely throughout the trip? I am not that good a conversation starter, and being the introvert I am - I don’t know if I will be able to meet people. Though all my accommodations are in hostels, let’s see where and how I land up there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spending too much  - As you start to book things, you discover new expenditures that totally disrupts your original budget. And this makes you feel guilty and you start to save money by not doing things that you really want to. Sad place to be in, but I am sure this is a very common thing among travellers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting into trouble - missing flights, losing money, etc etc - You can only pre-empt to a certain limit. But I am surely scared of such things - especially because I am alone. Moreover, money is tricky business. A long post on how I managed my money is on the cards, if I return without any mishap :p&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Food - This has never been a big question for me because “I eat to live”. Though, let’s see if I get enough vegetarian food there!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try to post my experiences every two days. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#5 - Breathing Again.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been just 19 days in 2018 and I have realised how different, surprising and unplanned this year is going to be. I left my first job to explore new things and it has been 19 days since and I have not improved my skillset even by a tiny notch. I say I took a break to get to know me more, but in reality I have not done any experiments to say that. Freelancing is not working, or rather I have not put in enough efforts to make it work. I am hardly reading any books. I started gym for a week and then have not worked out since the last five days. I got into a bit of a mix in the personal space.On the whole, I am just letting life slip by during one of the most amazing period of my life, a period which most only dreams of. But, I am just wasting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deciding what to do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I have left college, one thing I have learnt is the life outside the education bubble is very different because you yourself have to set goals, quantify it and then work to achieve it. Schools and colleges have exams, and marks or grades are the usual quantifiers. So it becomes easy. Out here, you are your own teacher and the student too. You have to set yourself a question paper, based on the syllabus you deem fit for you, then appear for it yourself, and finally evaluate too. Isn’t that scary? Yes it is, and it is the reason why most of us try to set a question paper that people have already appeared for. Doing something out-of-box, is scary, because you set out on uncharted waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took this break from my stint with SocialCops because of this very reason. I wanted to see whether I am made for this exploration of new paths, or should I quietly follow the normal trend. And to be honest, up till now I have failed myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whats stopping me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One, home&lt;/strong&gt;
Finally being at home with the intension of staying here, at least for the next three-four months have been comforting and serene. Spending time with my parents and family is very special. However, I am yet to settle down, find a schedule because for the past five years home has always been a holiday for me. And this comfort has brought an inertia which I need to let go off, and that too very fast. It again has to be a place where I learn and grow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two, my headspace.&lt;/strong&gt;
I am a bit too emotional and things that don’t go according to me affect me a lot. It affects everything around me and that is something I need to learn - keeping my personal &amp;amp; professional life separate. This will take time, I am sure. But hopefully, as the great Murakami puts it - “ When you come out of this storm, you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm is about”. I don’t want to be the same person again!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three, growth is not always about mastering something for your career.&lt;/strong&gt;
I had planned earlier that I would do certain things so that I can learn a bit more of R, and Python. However, slowly I am realising that maybe I should also focus on things which I would never again get time for. Abstract things, like learning to box or cooking, which will never help me make my career in data, but still it would be fun to learn right?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four, setting out goals and quantifying it.&lt;/strong&gt;
I have always been bad at this. But when you set out on your own, this becomes very crucial because goals will become your sacrosanct compass that will guide you the way in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five, Writing!&lt;/strong&gt;
I have always maintained this position where I say - I write because it forces me to try new things. Well, Achyut, then you need writing more than ever now. So weekly journals will be back. And I am heading to Thailand for a solo in Feb, so expect more of the travel blogs too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Six,Execute!&lt;/strong&gt;
One of my juniors in college told me - “Achyut, you preach a lot, but you fail in executing things”. And I accept it. And this is the most important of all - execute what you decide.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting my ass back to work, starting to step out of my comfort zone again and enjoying!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS. I am actively looking for any freelancing projects in the fields of - Data Science, Designing, Writing, or any shit (I have enough free time and thus will learn something new). So everyone who is reading this, help me get them :D&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#4 - The New Start.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So, as always, I did not end up making this a habit. Various incidences in my life have forced me to conclude that I can never create a routine of my own. But I badly want to challenge that conclusion and therefore instead of waiting for this to become a habit and then make it public, I will be posting every journal entry on Sundays over my facebook &amp;amp; instagram handle. Game on, life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to setup goals?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I started my first job, planning and managing my time is something that I am consciously trying to do. And one of the biggest learning that I have had is - “Have quantifiable success/failure measure against each of your goals”. So when you decide to complete a task A, have a measure in mind regarding when will you say that task is completed. It may seem very trivial, however when it comes to implementation, I am yet to discover the most efficient way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indonesia VS Philippines/Thailand?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am planning to do a month long backpacking trip to SE-Asia early next year. My main motivation to try this, it to understand whether I really like the concept of long-term travelling or I am a kind of person who just like the concept and does not want to get his hands dirty. I do hope I am not the later. Indonesia has always been on the top of my list, mainly because of a decent backpacking culture and the varied opportunities of learning to dive. However, Jan/Feb being the wettest months in Indonesia, slowly I am skeptical about my plans and I just might head to Philippines or Thailand. If anyone reading has any suggestions for this, please please do let me know :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Science of Productivity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was listing to this podcast by &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifehacker.com/charles-duhigg-on-self-motivation-mental-models-and-g-1793445660&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Upgrade&lt;/a&gt; where Charles Duhigg talks about various ways and psychologies of being productive. One thing that really struck me was the art of telling stories to your mind. Everyday in the metro, Duhigg closes his eyes and recreates the perfect day in his mind. He trains his brain to live that ideal day in the mind first and so, when it actually happens in real life, his brain already knows what to do. Micheal Phelps used a similar method to recreate a perfect winning swim before he went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it sounds logical too right? Train your brain for all the worst and the best things you can imagine of, and so when it happens in real-life, it is no different for you. I might try this, though I need to read more on how to do it exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Phone Hack!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://betterhumans.coach.me/a-phone-setup-that-will-make-you-more-mindful-1c5d8be7e661?source=rss----7038e003d060---4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt; where it struck me that even I have become addicted to my phone. Who has not right? In spite of having deleted Facebook, I still end up using Instagram quite regularly. So I followed some of the hacks mentioned in the blog to give my iphone a quick change. And within two days, I actually feel the change. Do give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#3 - The Crisis Land.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I missed writing the journal last week because of the Diwali celebrations at home. And there I am, writing this at 12 on a Sunday night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I hate dormancy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I have been too dormant of learning new things. I have kind of got used to completing the day-to-day work and then be satisfied with it. And the worst part? I know I don’t want to, but the motivation and the zeal have kind of flown away. I tried out following a technique - the first 2-3 hours in office, don’t complete the monotonous workload, rather spend these hours in learning new things. However, after two days of following it, something always used to end up on my desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to beat this dormancy? How to get back up and try to be the person you want to be? Is it because of the kind of workplace I am in, or is it because of me? I believe it is more to do with the kind of routine you follow. The day when you stop stepping out of your comfort zone, is the day you become dormant. I have no plans chalked out to beat this right now. All I have right now, is the intent to change. Hopefully when I write this next week, I have a plan in place :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theatre &amp;amp; Jazz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least on the trying out new things outside the professional world, I am not that dormant. I attended a beautiful play at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oddbird.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OddBird Theatre&lt;/a&gt;. The kind of intimate setting they had, and the whole experience around it was a first time for me. The organisers forced us to sit with strangers during the play. Also, as soon as everyone was settled in, there was silence for 5 minutes, a beautiful way to allow the audience to vent out all the thoughts before they can be totally attentive to the show. The play was &lt;a href=&quot;https://lbb.in/delhi/events/59f04bb8e470e5506c9b2727/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tadpole Repertory’s Quicksand&lt;/a&gt;, and anyone who is in Delhi, should absolutely experience this once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an intensive one-hour of theatre, it was Jazz time for me. Delhi’s much famous &lt;a href=&quot;http://thepianoman.in&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Piano Man&lt;/a&gt; was hosting Sharvi Yadav &amp;amp; Bohemia Voice. Such a musical experience was again a first time for me, and to say the least, it was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more new thing I did this week was try my hand at cooking. And to my surprise, I discovered cooking to be therapeutic. I did not cook anything fancy, just Egg Bhurji, half-fry and boiled eggs. But however small, it was fun and different. I will for sure cook more often.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#2 - The Week that was.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It really took some convincing to write this thing today. The only question popped up to me was, “Why should I write it when no one reads it?” But then, I write for myself :)
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Big Launch&lt;/strong&gt;
I was working on a project with the Ministry of Rural Development to develop a dashboard for monitoring 41 national schemes. It was finally launched by the Prime Minister on Wednesday in a grand event at Delhi. Apart from the 5 minutes where he launched our dashboard and spoke about the impact it will create, the event was boring &amp;amp; tiring. But yes, in my first job, the first project gets launched by the Prime Minister - it was surreal. You can read more about the project in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialcops.com/case-studies/disha-dashboard/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/strong&gt;
I have started to somewhere doubt my motivation to create a habit and follow it. It has been three months I have been in Delhi and yet I usually waste time when I am not in office. Netflix, youtube and the internet have become a regular time wasting machine. Also, the zeal to convert my ambitions into actions have reduced. Is it because of the job? Or is it just me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One App that I discovered this week&lt;/strong&gt;
I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reflectly-journal/id1241229134?mt=8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reflectly&lt;/a&gt;, which is a basic journalling application. The best thing I loved about this particular app, is the fact that is not monotonous. Everyday, the app asks you new questions which really makes you think about your day. Do give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#1 - Why Journaling?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, I love writing. But lately I have been thinking on the motivation behind it. I have been asked why I write and the best answer I can come up is, it pushes my boundaries, it pushes me to try new things in the first place so I can write about them. And frankly, that is the truth.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen many people try weekly journalling and lose their motivation within few weeks. Maybe I would too. But then I cannot not try with this fear right? So here I am, trying my hand at weekly journalling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will list down everything and anything that I want to share in these series of blog posts, which usually on normal weeks will be published on Sunday. The blogs will be raw &amp;amp; unedited so excuse the usage wrong incorrect grammar and sentence structures. I want to make this process as easy as possible so I can create a habit around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything going on in this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I am feeling as if I am letting my life slip by my hand. Work at SocialCops is very hectic and somewhere I lose out on the things I want to do for myself. The life revolves around work-home-work, and which I really hate myself for doing. So, from this week I decided to take a step back, and start getting the control again, be in the drivers seat, and not let life play me around. And it is tough, but if if not done now, I will never learn to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bulletjournal.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bullet Journaling&lt;/a&gt; is back. The last time I had tried this was in my final year of college when there were less things to manage. But now, when you have multiple projects going on at work, and also several personal projects and things, you need a way for organizing your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music?&lt;/strong&gt; I stumbled upon the several songs composed by Amit Trivedi for the upcoming movie Secret Superstar. And the songs are Amit Trivedi at his best. Do listen to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyZ0aXrpJIc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From next time I will start sharing great blogs that I read too. I need to figure out a way to best show them though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until next time, see ya!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is it really worth it?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Has anyone felt that sheer guilt from within?&lt;br /&gt;
something inside you wants to curse you,&lt;br /&gt;
break you, punch you and pull you down the stairs&lt;br /&gt;
into the infinite void till you cannot match your own sight&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have. And I have known this for long.&lt;br /&gt;
 But still I did nothing. &lt;br /&gt;
Or rather, we did nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four long years back, I left home to pursue my dreams.&lt;br /&gt;
I was always taught to dream big and,&lt;br /&gt;
fortunately or unfortunately,          &lt;br /&gt;
I dreamt bigger that my cosy little home city could provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was this unsaid understanding that         &lt;br /&gt;
one day I will leave home,    &lt;br /&gt;
but never really understood that         &lt;br /&gt;
I will never really be at home after that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Family gatherings started to become a rarity,  &lt;br /&gt;
Home-food a luxury and festival days just holidays.  &lt;br /&gt;
 But more importantly, I was never there  &lt;br /&gt;
I was never there for them, when they needed the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they wanted to learn a new app,&lt;br /&gt;
When they were facing issues with their mobiles,&lt;br /&gt;
When they wanted to be in sync with the modern world&lt;br /&gt;
or when they just wanted a kid in the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were always there, always.&lt;br /&gt;
They still are, and here I am,&lt;br /&gt;
trying to open my wings and fly away&lt;br /&gt;
when all they want is to fly with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it really worth it? &lt;br /&gt;
The success. The knowledge&lt;br /&gt;
The degrees. The work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it really worth it?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's borrow a Human : The Human Library Delhi</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Living alone in a big city like Delhi gets boring sometimes, especially on the weekend when you have watched almost everything on Netflix that interests you. But for a bibliophile like me, the city has a lot to offer. Storytelling meetups and workshops to some unique(at least for me!) ideas of borrowing a human for half an hour and reading him/her. Luckily I stumbled upon one such event in Delhi and I couldn’t just miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversations are at the core of this concept. Instead of books, there are real people with real stories, engaging their readers and answering their questions. A reader can choose from a variety of books and have a real conversation with them. Today’s event was a collaboration between Human Library Chapters in four cities - Delhi, Mumbai, Pune &amp;amp; Hyderabad. So instead of having the books sitting across our tables, we were connected over Google Hangouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole experience was surreal. We had two books(people) from Mumbai who shared their stories with us. One was a 30-32-year-old person, who narrated his experiences of being a Mercedes salesperson to backpacking the South-East Asia circuit and finally after several failed business plans starting a hippie cafe in Mumbai. And the second book was about how a guy fought and overcame the bruises that were caused by being abused in his childhood. They both were contrasting stories - one was funny and entertaining, and the other was gloomy and horrifying. But isn’t that who we really are - people with different sets of experiences and baggages? And listening to the experiences which I could not empathise even in my dreams and discovering the fact that those are so common made me realise how little I know about the world I live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell in love with the whole concept of Human Library today. I am sure I will be attending more of these wherever I go. If you get a chance, do visit one of these, I am certain it will be as heart-warming as it was for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://humanlibrary.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Human Library&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Humanlibrarydelhi/?ref=br_rs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Delhi Chapter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
