        <title>Dear Me</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I vividly remember the gloomy evening when&lt;br /&gt;
I boarded Suryanagri Express for the first time. &lt;br /&gt;
Three large suitcases, a bag on the shoulder,&lt;br /&gt;
and a million scattered thoughts.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My whole family had flooded the Platform 3&lt;br /&gt;
of Vadodara Junction to bid me farewell.&lt;br /&gt;
12480 slowly eases onto the station &lt;br /&gt;
amidst of all the chaos!    &lt;br /&gt;
And why not? It was a routine halt for the train.&lt;br /&gt;
As I rush into my coach, tears start to flood my eyes&lt;br /&gt;
as that one step marked the end of a beautiful chapter of my life.  &lt;br /&gt;
I was leaving for Jodhpur to attend &lt;br /&gt;
my undergraduate course at IIT Jodhpur.  &lt;br /&gt;
For a family that seldom expresses their emotions,&lt;br /&gt;
seeing them cry made me realise the magnitude of the occasion&lt;br /&gt;
I was no more a child.&lt;br /&gt;
I was growing up. We were growing up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then it happened. It might be cliched, &lt;br /&gt;
but the best days of my life begun.&lt;br /&gt;
Four years is a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;
Jodhpur became a home more than my home&lt;br /&gt;
And the people there became a part of me.&lt;br /&gt;
Seniors who guided me, classmates who walked with me &lt;br /&gt;
and juniors who made my experiences worth sharing.&lt;br /&gt;
Those years made me who I am today, and&lt;br /&gt;
taught me how to live, how to fail,&lt;br /&gt;
how to cry and how to have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time indeed is a treacherous clown.&lt;br /&gt;
It slows down when we really want to get through tough times &lt;br /&gt;
and it speeds past the memorable days &lt;br /&gt;
leaving behind some amazing memories.&lt;br /&gt;
My undergrad just flew past me, &lt;br /&gt;
without any space to breathe.  &lt;br /&gt;
It so happens, we just live for the time to pass&lt;br /&gt;
without realising the importance.  &lt;br /&gt;
And when the days got numbered,&lt;br /&gt;
I realised all the things I could have done,&lt;br /&gt;
all the conversations I could have made,&lt;br /&gt;
and the moments I could have actually lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day came. It started. &lt;br /&gt;
And it was the toughest day of my life.&lt;br /&gt;
10th May it was. The day when we parted,&lt;br /&gt;
the day when I changed.  &lt;br /&gt;
We had stayed up all night because &lt;br /&gt;
4 out of the 16 of us were leaving by a morning train.  &lt;br /&gt;
A planned sober night, which turned into&lt;br /&gt;
a night of a couple of BP shots.  &lt;br /&gt;
And for the final time, and&lt;br /&gt;
maybe the last, we 16 were together in one room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Promises of meeting again, &lt;br /&gt;
tight hugs to show our love,    &lt;br /&gt;
and moist eyes trying hard &lt;br /&gt;
to hold back on those tears.&lt;br /&gt;
And as the clocks neared 5 am, &lt;br /&gt;
we took a final walk of our home,&lt;br /&gt;
laid down on the misty grass of our garden &lt;br /&gt;
and watched the stars in silence&lt;br /&gt;
a silence filled with a million of &lt;br /&gt;
conversations and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Railway stations, airports and bus stops &lt;br /&gt;
are a mecca of goodbyes and farewells.    &lt;br /&gt;
I finally gave up and let the tears flow  &lt;br /&gt;
The final hug, the final glance &lt;br /&gt;
and the green signal&lt;br /&gt;
We were 4 down!&lt;br /&gt;
It should never have been this tough.  &lt;br /&gt;
But then if we had the guts &lt;br /&gt;
to build a friendship this strong,&lt;br /&gt;
Tears ought to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the evening my time was up.&lt;br /&gt;
We had somehow gotten used to saying goodbyes.  &lt;br /&gt;
So with simple hugs and a wide smile on my face,&lt;br /&gt;
I boarded the same Suryanagri Express,&lt;br /&gt;
on which I had started this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So dear me,&lt;br /&gt;
This is how it ended.&lt;br /&gt;
A big part of us died that day,&lt;br /&gt;
a part that will be remembered, cherished&lt;br /&gt;
and missed for the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life completes a full circle.&lt;br /&gt;
I cried on the first day,&lt;br /&gt;
because I was scared of what lied ahead.&lt;br /&gt;
And I cried on the last day,&lt;br /&gt;
because I was leaving a part of me behind.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Doing Mcleodganj Solo: Notes by a Novice</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For people who know me, understand how the word travelling can ignite a spark within me. For me, the only positive of staying in Delhi was being at an overnight distance to most of the destinations in the Himalayas. Three weeks into my first job, I was starting to curse myself for wasting three weekends and so hastily I booked my tickets to Dharamshala and my accommodation at Zostel-Mcleodganj. And this is how I found my north star, something that I can always go back to  - the concept of travelling alone!  
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A normal Friday evening. I left from work at 6. Briskly walked through the Delhi chaos. I reached home and packed a few tees and my bathroom pouch. My kindle and my diary were already sitting inside my bag. I rechecked my tickets, locked my house and started to walk for Saket metro. Usually, I listen to a podcast when I am travelling in the metro, but that Friday evening was different. I just stood near the door, with two small bags and nonchalantly gazed through the people. When I got out, the weather too was experiencing something contrasting - the first proper rains of the season. Finally, after an hour of waiting and navigating through the conundrum called ISBT, I boarded my bus to Dharamshala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  Mcleodganj is an experience that has been transformed by many travellers, either through their words or pictures. And I am an expert in neither. So, rather than trying to put the trip into words, I will make an attempt to express what Mcleodganj did to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ना मूज़े हिन्दी आती है,
and neither my English is perfect.     &lt;br /&gt;
But I love writing
और में लिख रहा हू |&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;में वो हू जो अपने आप में रहता है,
But my shells collapse like dominos,             &lt;br /&gt;
जब में लिख रहा होता हू ,
And I am writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my first, travelling solo. And frankly, I was shit scared. Being someone who finds it difficult to start a conversation and someone who thinks a lot about how others will perceive me, it was supposed to be a nightmare. But in fact, it turned out to be the exact opposite. The two days were a perfect mixture of solitude and meeting some warm &amp;amp; interesting people, which includes a designer from Delhi and an artist from Kolkata who calls himself Pablo. We met in the morning, explored the nooks and crannies of the town, talked about things ranging from college to Buddhism to meditation, had a drink at night and bid farewell to never see each other ever again. Can it get more spontaneous than this?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The art of doing nothing is something everyone should learn to practice. We always prefer to cut down our commute and take a taxi to the hotel. But imagine walking on the green serene curves of Himalayas, with the early morning drizzles hitting on the road and sometimes making their distinctive sound of dropping in a puddle. It might sound enchanting, but it was a long arduous walk with no map or humanity to guide. I was presented with cross roads every now and then, and sometimes I had to climb back up with my luggage when the road did not feel right. And yet, if given a chance, I would try to make many more mistakes just to walk more. Most people would consider this a big waste of time, but I say, once in a while indulge into doing nothing, just nothing. I sat for a couple of hours at this wooden porch of a cute little hostel in Dharamkot which silently sits hidden behind the majestic Himalayas. A dense cover of fog passes through me as I sip some hot green tea, observing rain drops falling from the ceiling. Apart from that, I was doing nothing. But I was having fun, and that is what matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having travelled the Himalayas a lot, I have visited many Monasteries and there is something different about the religion that has always fascinated me. Is it the calmness of the location or is it the intense devotion of the monks? Or is there a whole new reason yet to be discovered? I am not sure. But I will definitely read more about the religion and its practices which attract millions of people to backpack and spend several months in the little Lhasa. One thing is certain, the Namgyal Monastery, where His Holiness Dalai Lama lives, is a big disappointment, especially after you have visited some splendid places in Spiti and Bhutan. However, there was this one moment where monks were humming some mantra in perfect sync creating a congruous symphony that made the disappointment vanish for a few minutes and after that, well, it was back again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;image height=&quot;300em&quot; width=&quot;225em&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/mcleo1.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;/image&gt;
&lt;image height=&quot;300em&quot; width=&quot;375em&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/mcleo2.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;/image&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  The second day, I again walked down the same path. However this time, the road did not seem fascinating enough. I knew what was coming next and that somewhere took away the key ingredient of uncertainty. Is it always like that? Once you start going through the same path, you start getting used to it and slowly it ceases to excite and surprise you. Or does it depend on the individual? For me, it depends on the situation. But there is no denying that the first time, will always be in the top three!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  I got this unique opportunity to observe certain landmark areas during different times of a day - morning, afternoon, evening and night, because well I had nothing much to do. I believe that if you truly want to experience a place, visit it during all phases of the day. I can bet it on my life that the place will transform into something you had never expected. The colours, the smell, the people and the feeling, everything just switches and each part of the day has its own charm. Some are serene and some are filled with humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that we Indians never glorify our places and monuments. I remember visiting Lord’s in London. The stadium was not something extra ordinary. You will find similar or better stadiums around the world. But then what was different at Lord’s? The whole experience that they have created makes it royal and grand. The Dharamshala Cricket Stadium is one of the most scenic cricket stadiums in the world, but we never create that kind of experience around it. The stadium looked pale and lonely with just the Dhauladhar range trying to make up for the bland surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;image height=&quot;300em&quot; width=&quot;275em&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/mcleo3.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;/image&gt;
&lt;image height=&quot;300em&quot; width=&quot;375em&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/mcleo4.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;/image&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my second and the last day, I was sitting in this cosy little cafe in Mcleodganj, reading Kafka on the Shore with slow moving clouds in front of my eyes. I sat there for around four hours. When travelling alone, there will be times, especially near the end of your trip, when you would yearn to have someone with you. You start to regret for not have planned the trip to perfection. And the most difficult part is shaking those thoughts because they will come for sure. I had those exact same thoughts in that cafe, but the book, the view and the hot ginger lemon slowly erased those thoughts out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; And I love living,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;और मैं जी रहा हूँ |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Why to keep a log file and how to keep it in R?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the first things we are taught in Programming 101 is to write a well structured &amp;amp; commented code. And as any newbie would, we ignore this lesson and focus on achieving the end result. Continuing the same learnings, I coded a R(the R language!) script to be run on files amounting to 30GBs! This was my first professional experience after my graduation and I did not want to fuck up. So, I structured the code, wrote all the comments and ran it on all the files. And what happened next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All files were not structured the same way and so my script broke for a few files, leaving my final dataset void of some very important data. Moreover, my script was deleting some rows from every file, and thus again I was tampering with the original dataset without any logical and concrete reason behind it. It might not sound something as significant as not achieving the final goal, but believe me, in &lt;em&gt;data science if your data is not representative of the true dataset, your analysis is considered void.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Log file is a file that records events that occur during a process. It basically helps to track back the process and discover if anything has gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons to keep a Log File&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how to account for such cases? &lt;em&gt;Maintain a Log File&lt;/em&gt;! If you need more reasons for maintaining a log file, here are few I can think of -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large datasets follow Murphy’s Law. &lt;em&gt;Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.&lt;/em&gt; And log file is the best way to keep a check&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While running a common script on several multiple files, log file will give you a gist of the whole process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Log file will help for future reference, for your own self and also for others who will use the script or the dataset again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to write in a log file?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, okay! I know log file is important, but what do I write in the log file? &lt;em&gt;It depends on the use case.&lt;/em&gt; As someone who works with data daily, I usually maintain the following parameters in my log file -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Total number of Files the script was run for&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File names&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Number of rows in each file (before and after processing)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Number of Columns in each file (before and after processing)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any specific parameter important to the particular dataset&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Processing time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to keep a log file in R?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;createLog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;log_con&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;process.log&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;w&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nrow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;log_con&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very basic way to keep a log file. I prefer using this function in every script because it gives me the freedom to choose the contents of my log file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When Breath Becomes Air - Paul Kalanithi</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have never been a big fan of memoirs or biographies. However, Bill Gate’s on Paul Kalanithi’s autobiography motivated me to give this genre a try. I remember picking up this book on a train journey, and finishing it in one go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Death is never easy, especially when you know it is coming. Paul, a young ambitious surgeon who was at his peak, suddenly finds out that he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. When breath becomes Air, is the journey from this realization to his very last breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What happened to Paul was tragic, but he was not a tragedy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are basically two different sets of experiences that the author goes through - one, is how he being a doctor takes on the challenge of being a patient and two, is the obvious personal and professional trauma he and his family undergoes. The author also shares his view on faith &amp;amp; science and how he distinguishes between them. Those thoughts would not be as impactful as they would seem when supplemented with the raw &amp;amp; blunt writing of Paul Kalanithi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally found the whole narration of his residency days a bit boring and lengthy. However, that very part gave an inside look to the surgeon side of the author, which in retrospect becomes very important to understand the whole story. Paul’s motivation and strength to write this book in the middle of all the pains of chemo-therapy is highly commendable. But I guess, writing was always Paul’s first love and he died doing what he loved the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not know this person before reading this book and neither did I search about him after reading it. But the kind of impact his words and his thoughts create is boundless. I am sure Paul would not have liked to make his book a synonym for death and tragedy. Read it to understand a magnificent man who lived the best he could, and at the end that is what really matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure I will pick this book again. This book has so branches of meanings that you ought to discover new ones when you read it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was the life he was given, and this is what he made of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the highlighted lines which I totally fell in love with  -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the unexamined life was not worth living, was the unlived life worth examining?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You could not help but feel your specklike existence against the immensity of the mountain, the earth, the universe, and yet still feel your own two feet on the talus, reaffirming your presence amid the grandeur.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don’t believe in the wisdom of children, nor in the wisdom of the old. There is a moment, a cusp, when the sum of gathered experience is worn down by the details of living. We are never so wise as when we live in this moment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looking out over the expanse ahead I saw not an empty wasteland but something simpler: a blank page on which I would go on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you come to one of the many moments in life where you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man’s days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Although these last few years have been wrenching and difficult—sometimes almost impossible—they have also been the most beautiful and profound of my life, requiring the daily act of holding life and death, joy and pain in balance and exploring new depths of gratitude and love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(I have a long list of highlights, do ping me if you want to read them.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>And We Part</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;And then we left for our own ways, just like we had come together after walking our own path on that sunny July 21st morning. Who knew, these four years will make us into friends, enemies, partners in crime, shoulders to cry on, faces we despise, but at the end, these very same people will make us cry while bidding our final goodbyes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always disliked endings. Whether it was when I completed a great book , a high school farewell or an end to a memorable trip, it was always tough. This is one of such moments, where everything I knew, everything I was a part of, and everything that has shaped me into “me” is coming to an end. I am separating from a place which was &lt;em&gt;“my home more than my home”&lt;/em&gt; for four years.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;image src=&quot;/assets/images/farewell.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;/image&gt;

&lt;p&gt; There have been countless memories we have shared, but the foremost thing I will miss for the years to come are the people I met here. &lt;em&gt;Seniors who guided us, classmates who walked with us &amp;amp; juniors who made our experiences worth sharing.&lt;/em&gt; It is amusing how I have stored all names in my phone with IITJ behind them. But the fact is, there is no need of an “IITJ” to remind me who these people are. Not even in my wildest dream can I forget these people, or confuse them with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is only when you are about to lose something, do you realise its true value in life. These past weeks have been emotionally toiling, to say the least. You get a strange feeling when you are about to leave a place. Like you’ll not only miss the people you love but you’ll miss the person you are now at this time and this place, because you will never be this way ever again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ujjwal Anand beautifully summed up my emotions today -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Doesn’t matter how hard you try, if you have the guts to build a friendship this strong, have the balls to face the tears, cause they will come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as I glance at that GPRA gate for the last time wiping those tears, myriad of memories flash across my mind. Today, a part of me dies. A part that will always be remembered, but which can never be resurrected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fare Thee Well IITJ! Fare Thee Well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Podcast #2 - Startify : The Journey of Student Entrepreneurs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Startify has been one of the best decisions of my undergraduate life. We got this idea of documenting our journey in
a form of a podcast when we were traveling with our E-Cell juniors. We had real fun while making this. Enjoy the
conversation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This podcast revolves around three IIT undergrad students, who took the leap and started up Startify in their sophomore year. Startify is basically an online incubation hub which helps startup grow. Startify has been acquired by an incubator based out of Jaipur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The podcast is in the form of a story - right from how the founders met, ideated, to how they got their first customer and the much famous exit. The founders have tried to share their learnings at every juncture of their journey. Part 1 of the podcast is more fun and less knowledge, but as you go further into the second part, the story becomes more exciting with some pointed takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shout out to Abhinav, Karthik and E-Cell IIT Jodhpur for all the help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Podcast #1 - What If</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to record a podcast of my own. And finally, after many failed attempts, we recorded this
when we had gone out for a dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This podcast basically consists of three final year undergraduate students(one of them is obviously me), contemplating on their journey so far. We discussed a hypothetical situation where we were guaranteed our dream career on the first day of
college, and then how this would have changed our stay at IIT Jodhpur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is our first podcast, so I am certain that there are several mistakes. However, we enjoyed as hell while making it, and I am sure you will do too, when you hear the conversation. We are waiting for your reviews!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/314453779&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&quot;&gt;

        <title>A Ride in a Metro</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been to many metro cities around the world, but the energy and liveliness we have in the metros of India cannot be matched. The Indian culture of family and the way we interact is something very unique. In this every adaptive world and times when we are adopting the western culture in all ways, this is something we should always hold on to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was traveling from MG Road metro to Baiyananihalli in Bengaluru. It was a Sunday and I met a big group of people, talking loudly, laughing and enjoying their time together. If it was a Toronto or London, such loud noise would be considered as bad manners. But here, it made the whole train lively and humane. Such small moments in our ever busy mundane schedule, makes living in India meaningful!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Powerpoints - How not to make them?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;PowerPoint was developed by engineers as a tool to help them communicate in a better way. The programmers behind PowerPoint saw it as a clever hack—a way to save time and money instead of creating slides the old fashioned way. It is an amazing tool for presenting your ideas in a way that the audience can relate to! However, we, the users, have made a complete mockery of presentations. To a certain extent, Microsoft is to blame for the dismal built-in wizards, templates and clip-arts - those hideous Microsoft creations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have noticed some abysmal design mistakes in various powerpoints. Some of them which can be easily prevented are -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text Too Small&lt;/strong&gt; - Before deciding on the text size of your content, you should understand the size of the audience and the room you will be presenting it. Change your font size accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dreadful colour schemes&lt;/strong&gt; - There is no point of your powerpoint if your colour scheme sucks and as a result, no one is able to understand the slides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too many bullet points&lt;/strong&gt; - Bullet points are supposed to be used to communicate important points. Never use them in excess otherwise they lose the importance&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad selection of fonts&lt;/strong&gt; - Being a novice designer myself, there are no words through which I can emphasize the importance of fonts. I spend at least 30 minutes to decide my fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Videos and Audios never work&lt;/strong&gt; - Embedded videos and audios don’t work most of the time. Moreover, they break the flow of your presentation. Play them either at the end or at the start. Avoid them in the middle of your presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too many slide transitions &amp;amp; animations&lt;/strong&gt; - They do more bad than good. These can get rather tiring on the audience and thus keep the powerpoint simple.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading off each word&lt;/strong&gt; - Did your audience really have to come all this way to a meeting to listen to you read the slides? Why not just send them over? Never, just never make this mistake!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one underlying fact every one of us should understand is - &lt;em&gt;presentations are made to make communication seamless and easy.&lt;/em&gt; Therefore before presenting, take a moment and imagine yourself as the audience and ask the question - “Will this powerpoint aid me to understand the idea better?”. If you have even a 5% of doubt, change the powerpoint!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As Seth Godin rightly points out, Communication is the transfer of emotion. Communication is about getting others to adopt your point of view, to help them understand why you’re excited (or sad, or optimistic or whatever else you are.) PowerPoint presents an amazing opportunity. You can use the screen to talk emotionally to the audience’s right brain (through their eyes), and your words can go through the audience’s ears to talk to their left brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain Pointers that will help you become a better presenter -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cue Cards&lt;/strong&gt; -  Make yourself a cue card for each slide. It should cover all the points that you want to make and thus these cards will provide a basic framework and storyline for your presentation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slides to aid your words&lt;/strong&gt; - Make slides that reinforce your words, not repeat them&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Leave-behind&lt;/strong&gt; - Create a printed document which works as a summary of your content and give it to your audience after you have finished with your presentation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No more than &lt;strong&gt;six words on a slide&lt;/strong&gt;. EVER.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10/20/30 Rule&lt;/strong&gt; -  It recommends limiting the number of your slides to 10 and your presentation time to 20 minutes but using at least a 30-point font size.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will find many such hacks and rules that provide you with a framework to make the most from your powerpoint presentation. However, you will have to decide your own rules suiting your style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, PowerPoints and other presentation tools are visual aids. You want to connect how your slide looks to what you’re saying and present it in a form of a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The home run is easy to describe: You put up a slide. It triggers an emotional reaction in the audience. They sit up and want to know what you’re going to say that fits in with that image. Then, if you do it right, every time they think of what you said, they’ll see the image (and vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In Power of Habit, the author examines why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while other seem to remake themselves overnight. The book is divided into three sections, namely Individual, Company and Societies. The author discusses how habits are formed in all three areas with some compelling evidences. Personally, I have always disliked self-help books due to the sole reason of them being boring. But surprisingly, Charles Duhigg has found an interesting way to present boring tips through this best-seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part A – Individual Habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ch- 1  The Habit Loop:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we picture our brain as an onion, composed of layers of cells, then the outside layers – those closest to the scalp – are generally the most recent additions from an evolutionary perspective. Deep inside is where automatic behaviours occur. One such part of the brain – basal ganglia, controls habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process in which the brain converts a sequence of actions into the an automatic routine is known as chunking and it is at the root of habit formation. Examples of behavioral chunks –  You automatically putting toothpaste on toothbrush before putting it into your mouth. Habits emerge because the brain in constantly looking for ways to save effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Habit process within our brain is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go to automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally , there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ch-2 The Craving Brain (How to create new habits)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of Pepsodent – How Hopkins made Americans develop the habit of brushing in the morning(a way to advertise Pepsodent). How ever complex the whole idea seems, everything burns down to three things – cue, routine, reward. He learned the right human psychology which was grounded in two basic rules – Find a simple and obvious cue and second clearly define the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prof Wolfram Schultz conducted a few experiments on monkeys to know the inner workings of the brain during the habit loop. He found out that once the habit has been created, the monkeys craved of the rewards, and when they didn’t arrive, they began to go mad. Therefore, habits are very powerful: they create neurological cravings. Most of the time, these cravings emerge so gradually that we are not really aware they exist. But as we associate cues with certain reward, a subconscious craving emerges in our brains that start the habit loop spinning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way new habits are created – by putting together a cue, a routine and a reward, and then cultivating a craving that drives the loop. The cue in addition to triggering a routine must also trigger a craving for the reward to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers need some kind of signal that a product is working. For instance, all toothpaste have a cool tinge irrespective of the flavour. This cool tinge does not help in cleaning our teeth, rather they leave behind a cool effect which indirectly makes us believe that the tooth-paste has done its job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ch-3 The Golden Rule of Habit Change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of Tony Dungy and his rugby team – Tony Dungy’s coaching philosophy was that the key to winning was changing player’s habits. He wanted players to stop making so many decisions during the game. He wanted them to react automatically, habitually. Dungy only wanted to target the middle step – routine. It is easier to convince someone to adopt a new behaviour if there was something familiar at the beginning and end.To change a habit, you must keep the old cue and reward and but change the routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of Alcoholics Anonymous – AA forces addicts to identify the cues and the rewards that encourage their alcoholic habits, and then helps them find new behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change an old habit, you have to target the old craving. You have to keep the same cues and rewards as before and feed the craving by inserting a new routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However even if you give people better habits, it doesn’t repair why they started drinking in the first place. Eventually, they will have a bad day and no new routine is going to make everything seem okay. What can make a difference is believing that they can cope with that stress without alcohol. People might be skeptical about their ability to change if they are by themselves, but a group will convince them to suspend disbelief. A community creates belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habits are most malleable when the Golden Rule of Habit is applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PART B – Organisations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ch -4 Keystone Habits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example – Alcoa and its CEO Paul O’Neill – O’Neill believed that some habits have the power to start a chain reaction, changing other habits as they move through an organisation. Some habits matter more than others in remaking businesses and lives. These are called “Key Stone Habits”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keystone habits say that success doesn’t depend on getting every single thing right, but instead relies on identifying a few key priorities and fashioning them into powerful levers. Individuals have habits and organisations have routines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bring Alcoa back on track, O’Neill figured out his top priority would be something that everyone – unions and executives- could agree was important. He needed a focus that would bring people together, that would give him leverage to change how people worked and communicated. He chose Safety! The key to protecting Alcoa employees was understanding why injuries happened. And to understand the why you had to study how the process was going wrong. To understand how things were going wrong, you had to bring in people who could educate about quality control and safety. In short, to protect the workers, Alcoa needed to become the best, most streamlined aluminum company on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you focus on changing or cultivating keystone habits, you can cause widespread shifts. Keystone habits offer what is known within academic literature as “small wins”. They help other habits to flourish by creating new structures, and they establish cultures where change becomes contagious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example – Michael Phelps – Phelps’s coach, Bowman believed that key to victory was creating right routines. All he needed to do was target few specific habits that had nothing to do with swimming and everything to do with creating right mindset. Bowman would tell Phelps to go home and “watch the video-tape, which was a mental visualization of a perfect race, before he goes to sleep and when he wakes up”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favour another small win. Small wins fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advantages into patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are within reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ch – 5  When Willpower becomes Automatic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example – Starbucks – Starbucks teach their employees via classroom sessions the basic methods and ways to deal with a Starbucks customer. At the core of the education is an intense focus on an all important habit : willpower. Willpower is the single most important keystone habit for individual success. The best way to strengthen willpower is to make it into a habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Willpower isn’t just a skill. It is a muscle, and it gets tired as it works harder.  If you want to do something that requires willpower, you have to conserve your willpower till that time of the day. As people strengthen their willpower in one part of their lives, that strength spilled over into other things and touched everything. Good habits spill over into other parts of lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Starbucks LATTE method – We Listen to the customer, Acknowledge their complaint, Take action by solving the problem, Thank them and then Explain why the problem occurred. This is how willpower becomes a habit – by choosing a certain behavior ahead of time, and then following that routine when an inflection point arrives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parents should ask such questions to help their children learn how to set goals – “How are you going to study tonight”, “What are you going to do tomorrow”,  “How do you know you are ready for the tests?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people are asked to do something that takes self-control, if they think they are doing it for personal reasons – if they feel it’s like a choice or something that they enjoy because it helps someone else – it’s much less taxing. If they feel like they have no autonomy, their willpower muscles get tired much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply giving employees a sense of agency – a feeling that they are in control, that they have actual decision-making control – can radically increase how much energy and focus they bring to their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ch – 6 Power of Crisis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no organisations without institutional habits. There are only places where they are deliberately designed, and places where they are created without forethought. Sometimes in the heat of a crisis, the right habits emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nelson and Winter’s theories – Much of firm behavior is best understood as a reflection of general habits and strategic orientations coming from the firm’s past rather than the result of a detailed survey of remote twigs of decision tree. Firms are guided by long-held organisational habits, patterns that often emerge from thousand of employees’ independent decisions. The organizational habits or routines provide hundred of unwritten rules that companies need to operate. They allow workers to experiment with new ideas without having to ask for permission at every step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important benefits of routines is that they create truces between potential warring groups or individuals within an organisation. Organisational routines provide a basic promise – if everyone follows the established patterns and abide by the truce, then rivalries won’t destroy the company, the profits will roll in and eventually everyone will get rich. For an organisation to work, leaders must cultivate habits that both create a real and balanced peace and, paradoxically make it absolutely clear who’s in charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good leaders seize crises to remake organisational habits. A company with dysfunctional habits can’t turn around simply because a leader orders it. Rather, wise executives seek out moments of crisis- or create the perception of crisis- and cultivate the sense that something must change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ch 7- How Target knows what you want before you do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers act like creatures of habit, automatically repeating past behaviors with little regard to current goals. Yet each person’s habits are different. People’s buying habits are more likely to change when they go through a major life event. And the biggest change is having a baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that a preference for that thing that sound familiar is a product of our neurology. Listening habits allow us to unconsciously separate important noises from those that can’t be ignored. Radio listeners didn’t want to make a conscious decision each time they were presented with a new song. Instead, their brains wanted to follow a habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listeners are happy to sit through a song they might dislike as long as it seems something they have heard before. Pregnant women are happy to use coupons they receive in the mail unless those coupons make it obvious that Target is spying on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By dressing something new in old clothes, and making the unfamiliar seem familiar” – the golden rule for making your product viral. How to do this? Sandwich theorem – Sandwich the unfamiliar between the familiar. If you dress something new in old habits, it is easier for the public to accept it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part – C Habits of Societies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social habits are what fill streets who may not know one another, who are marching for different reasons, but who are all moving in the same direction. A movement starts because of Social habits of friendship and strong ties between close acquaintances. It grows because of habits of community, and the weak ties that hold neighbourhoods and clans together. And it endures because leaders give participants new habits that create a fresh sense of identity and a feeling of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an idea to grow beyond a community, it must become self-propelling. And the surest way to achieve that is to give people new habits that help them figure out where to go on their own.

  &lt;li&gt;Experiment with rewards&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Have a plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
