            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p><strong>Aspect Extraction and Opinion Analysis</strong> is an academic project as a part of the <a target="_blank"  href="https://poloclub.github.io/cse6242-2018fall-campus/">CSE6242 course </a>offered by Dr Polo Chau at Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
            <p>The whole project has been made open-source and the codebase is available on Github <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ishikaarora4/Aspect-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Amazon-Reviews">here </a></p>
            <p>Opinion mining or sentiment analysis is the computational analysis of a personâ€™s emotion towards entities like products and services. It can be done at three levels - document, sentence and aspect. We have implemented an aspect-based analysis system to extract various aspects of an entity from Amazon product reviews, group them and determine the respective polarities.</p>

            <h2 id="why">Why this Project?</h2>
            <p> Giving a bad review for a product seldom means that it is bad in every aspect. If an Amazon delivery was delayed by a week, the bad review would not necessarily reflect product quality. It is important for customers and sellers to understand what exactly the negative review was about.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consumers and sellers spend a large amount of time reading through long reviews to find out what is perceived as good and bad about a product. Amazon currently has a feature that lets users filter reviews by popular keywords, which is still tedious and time-consuming for customers. The users have to read through numerous reviews to get the relevant information about the products that they need.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Looking at the example below, we can notice that a mobile can have two main aspects - battery & camera. Customers and sellers both can gain insights if a model can identify the opinions of such aspects - </p>

            <h2 id="tech">Solution Overview</h2>
            <p> When we step back and think about different steps involved in the process, the pipeline seems very complicated. The intuition behind our model is that the aspects extracted from a set of reviews of a product can be similar or related to one other. Users may discuss the same features of a product in different words; clustering the aspects before determining the most frequently mentioned aspects would prevent the omission of key aspects. Additionally, it will also ensure that there is no redundancy. </p>

            <p>We broke down the whole process into sub modules -  </p>


            <br>
            <ul class="step-text">
              <li>
                <h5>Getting the data ready</h5>
                <p>Amazon has made all the product reviews from 1995-2015 available on S3 buckets. This made the first part of any data science pipeline - Getting the data, a bit easy for the project. However, the massive size of the dataset brought its own set of challenges. </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h5>Identifying Aspects</h5>
                <p>The objective of this step was to extract instances of product aspects and modifiers that express the opinion about a particular aspect.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h5>Grouping Aspects into clusters and giving polarity scores</h5>
                <p>The extracted aspects were grouped into different clusters, each denoting a distinct property of the product. And based on the modifiers, polarity scores were given to each cluster.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h5>Visualising the results</h5>
                <p>With the motive of developing an end-product, we modelled an interactive UI so that users can gain insights from reviews. </p>
              </li>

            </ul>
