I always wanted to record a podcast of my own. And finally, after many failed attempts, we recorded this
when we had gone out for a dinner.

This podcast basically consists of three final year undergraduate students(one of them is obviously me), contemplating on their journey so far. We discussed a hypothetical situation where we were guaranteed our dream career on the first day of
college, and then how this would have changed our stay at IIT Jodhpur.

This is our first podcast, so I am certain that there are several mistakes. However, we enjoyed as hell while making it, and I am sure you will do too, when you hear the conversation. We are waiting for your reviews!
