It has been one week since I returned from my Thailand expedition - and it has not been that bad. Obviously, I don’t think I will ever be satisfied with myself, and that is perfectly okay. So, I hit the gym regularly for the whole week. I set up a good working space at my home - though could not work as much as I wanted to. But at least, there is some start.

I have always tried to be an all-rounder - doing a good bunch of things whenever I got the chance. It might be because of the way I was brought up or because I have an acute fear of missing out. This has placed me in a box where I am a master of none. Therefore one thing that I have decided is to try going deep into a subject this time. And I spent the later part of the week deciding the field I want to go deep into - a classic case of me fearing of missing out, again! I have already taken up a few things - more on this next week.

I am also trying to automate the email updates for my blog through Mailchimp. Though, I need to figure out a way through which MailChimp selects RSS feeds of only certain categories of posts and convert it into a newsletter. And this has to be compatible with Jekyll and Github Pages. I will dig into this more the coming week!

__Interesting Stumbles__

- [Blockchain](https://medium.com/mimir-blockchain/the-birds-the-bees-and-the-merkle-trees-ep-0-blockchains-from-scratch-3cedb1e669eb){:target="_blank"} - I have not completed this, but so far, this post have really helped to know the subject
- [Nerdwriter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJkMlOu7faDgqh4PfzbpLdg ){:target="_blank"} - An insightful youtube channel that is just a great way to spend time on the internet rather than surfing through the shit called Facebook
- This is Us - The newest drama in my list which I binged watched through the week. For all those who are fans of good-old classic drama, This is Us won’t disappoint.

__Books,Books and Books__

- [Smarter, Faster and Better](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0434023469/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3638&creative=24630&creativeASIN=0434023469&linkCode=as2&tag=achyutjoshi-21&linkId=63448d3e15ac4d5b82637cd3194e0a02){:target="_blank"} -I took up this book after hearing Duhigg talk about Mental Models in a Freakonomics podcast. I have completed around 30% of it it, and so far, there has been nothing extra-ordinary in the book. I have always been a big fan of Duhigg's writing style, so hopefully this won't disappoint.
- [1Q84](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0099578077/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=achyutjoshi-21&creative=24630&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0099578077&linkId=c7e966ae5f27509bfa376cf8eba3f0fb){:target="_blank"} - Murakami has this power of gripping your attention throughout the book. Another masterpiece by this Japanese superstar.


__Music Discovery__

I have often heard my friends telling how they hate finding new music. And yes, it is a pain-staking process. But I have these few hours once every two weeks where I devote the time to discover new music. Why not share them with the world?
