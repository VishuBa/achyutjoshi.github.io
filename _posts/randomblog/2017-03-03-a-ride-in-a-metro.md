Yesterday I was traveling from MG Road metro to Baiyananihalli in Bengaluru. It was a Sunday and I met a big group of people, talking loudly, laughing and enjoying their time together. If it was a Toronto or London, such loud noise would be considered as bad manners. But here, it made the whole train lively and humane. Such small moments in our ever busy mundane schedule, makes living in India meaningful!
