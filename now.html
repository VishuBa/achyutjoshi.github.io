<h4> What I am doing right now </h4>

I am currently in Vadodara focusing on these things -
<ul>
<li>Compiling all my stories from my first solo packing to Thailand into blog posts</li>
<li>Trying to learn how to be more focused on only a handful of things - lets go depth rather than breadth!</li>
<li>Spending time with my family and trying my hand at cooking a bit</li>
<li>Always Be Reading, currently -
	<ul>
	<li><a href ="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733966-smarter-faster-better" target="_blank">Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business</a></li>
</ul>
<li>Listening to <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/" target="_blank" > The Tim Ferris Show</a> and <a href="http://freakonomics.com/archive/" target="_blank"> The Freakonomics Radio </a></li>

</ul>
